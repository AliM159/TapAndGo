# TapAndGo – Smart ATM Reservation System (Concept Design)

TapAndGo is a **conceptual mobile banking system** that introduces an ATM **reservation** and **contactless cash withdrawal** feature (e.g., via QR code or NFC).  

This project was created as part of a **Software Requirements Engineering / Systems Design** course to practice formal documentation, modelling, and database design.

> Note: This repository focuses on **documentation and design artifacts**.  
> It is **not a full production-ready application**.

## Project Goals

- Reduce waiting time and crowding at ATMs
- Improve user convenience with reservations and contactless withdrawal
- Demonstrate structured requirements, system design, and database planning

## Contents

Depending on how the repo is structured, it may include:

- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**  
  - Functional and non-functional requirements  
  - Use cases and system constraints

- **UML Diagrams**  
  - Use case diagrams  
  - Class diagrams  
  - Activity/sequence diagrams  
  - System context diagrams

- **Database Design**  
  - ERD or schema diagrams  
  - Sample SQL scripts for tables and relationships

- **Other Artifacts**  
  - Stakeholder analysis  
  - Assumptions, risks, and design decisions

## Technologies / Tools Used

- **UML / Modelling Tools** (draw.io, Lucidchart, Visio or similar)
- **SQL / Database Concepts**
- **Word / PDF** for documentation
- General **SDLC** and **requirements engineering** practices

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the documentation files (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`) to read the SRS and design details.
3. Review the UML diagrams to understand the system architecture and flows.
4. If SQL scripts are included, you can:
   - Open them in a SQL environment (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, or SQL Developer)
   - Create sample tables to explore the database structure

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

- Requirements gathering and documentation (SRS)
- System modelling using UML
- Database schema design for a financial application
- Applying SDLC steps from concept to design

## Possible Future Work

- Implement a working prototype (web or mobile frontend + backend API)
- Integrate authentication and security mechanisms
- Connect the system to a real or mock banking database
- Add test plans and test cases for key scenarios
